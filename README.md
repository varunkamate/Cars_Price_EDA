🚗 Car Price Prediction - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) notebook on a car price dataset. The primary objective of this analysis is to uncover patterns, trends, and insights related to car prices based on various features such as:

Brand and model

Engine type and size

Number of doors

Body style

Fuel type

Transmission type

City vs highway mileage

And more

📊 What’s Inside
Data cleaning and preprocessing

Univariate and bivariate visualizations

Correlation heatmaps and pair plots

Insights on features affecting car prices

Boxplots, histograms, and bar charts

Visual comparison of prices across various attributes (like number of doors)

🔧 Tools Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook

📁 File Structure
car_price_EDA.ipynb: Main notebook containing code, visualizations, and commentary

📌 Future Scope
This EDA can be extended to:

Build predictive models (e.g., regression)

Deploy dashboards (e.g., with Streamlit or Dash)

Feature engineering for machine learning
